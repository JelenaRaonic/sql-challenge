This project is research on employees whom company employed during 1980s and 1990s. All those informations are storaged in six CSV files. My task is to design tables to hold the data form those six CSV files into SQL database, and do data analysis.

This project has 3 parts:

1. ### Data Modeling
    Entity Relationship Diagram is created with QuickDBD.
  
2. ### Data Engineering
   Table schema for each of the six CSV files is created and CSV files are imported into its corresponding SQL table. For each table it is checked that data is imported 
   correctly from each corresponding CSV file.

3. ### Data Analysis
