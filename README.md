This project is research on employees whom company employed during 1980s and 1990s. All those informations are storaged in six CSV files. My task is to design tables to hold the data form those six CSV files into SQL database, and do data analysis.

This project has 3 parts:
1. Data Modeling - In this part Entity Relationship Diagram is created with QuickDBD.
  
2. Data Engineering - In this part table schema for each of the six CSV files is created and CSV files info are imported into its corresponding SQL table. It was checked for each table that data is imported correctly from each corresponding CSV file.
